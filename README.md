## üíª Project Introduction

### a. Overview
‚úçÔ∏è **TASK MIND** is an innovative task management application designed specifically for Vietnamese university students. Unlike traditional to-do apps that only focus on deadlines, TASK MIND introduces **energy-based task management** combined with **AI-powered recommendations**. The app helps students work more effectively by matching tasks to their current energy levels, reducing stress and increasing productivity through intelligent planning and visual analytics.

### b. Key Features & Function Manual
**üîπ 1. Comprehensive Task Management (CRUD)**
* Create, edit, delete, and complete tasks with rich metadata
* Each task includes: title, deadline, priority (Low/Medium/High), complexity (Low/Medium/High), estimated duration, notes
* Overdue tasks automatically highlighted with visual indicators
* One-click task completion with timestamp tracking

**üîπ 2. Realtime Cloud Synchronization**
* All data stored on Firebase Firestore ensuring:
  * Permanent storage (no data loss on reload)
  * Real-time multi-device synchronization (mobile ‚Äì web ‚Äì desktop)
  * Instant updates across all connected devices

**üîπ 3. Multi-View Interface**
1. **List View**: Display tasks with Priority and Complexity tags, sidebar with Quick Filters (Today, High Priority, Medium Priority, Low Complexity), smart search functionality
2. **Calendar View**: 4 viewing modes (Month ‚Äì Week ‚Äì Day ‚Äì Agenda), color-coded tasks by priority, deadline visualization to prevent scheduling conflicts
3. **Analytics View**: Complexity √ó Priority Heatmap showing task density matrix, Tasks distribution by Priority/Complexity, Completed Tasks Trend analysis over time

**üîπ 4. Smart Time Management**
* Automatic status display: Today, Upcoming, Overdue
* Completion timestamp tracking for productivity analysis
* Total and average duration statistics per task category

**üîπ 5. AI Assistant (Beta)**
* Direct chat interface for:
  * Quick queries about deadlines, pending tasks, overdue items
  * Task recommendations based on current energy level + Value vs Effort matrix
  * Auto Task Creation from Image (OCR): upload images (schedules, handwritten to-dos) for automatic task generation

### c. Unique Features (What's special about this app?) 
* **Energy-first Workflow**: Instead of only following deadlines, TASK MIND helps choose tasks that match your current energy state, reducing stress and increasing productivity
* **Automatic Priority Calculation**: Based on Value vs. Effort Matrix (Complexity √ó Impact) for intelligent task ranking
* **Complexity √ó Priority Heatmap**: Visual workload distribution matrix for quick priority identification
* **Completed Tasks Trend**: Time-based completion analysis helping students identify:
  * üìà Peak productivity periods (daily/weekly patterns)
  * üìâ Low productivity times ‚Üí can be improved by choosing appropriate tasks
* **3 Visual Modes**: List, Calendar, Analytics for comprehensive task overview
* **Integrated AI Assistant**: 
  * Next task suggestions based on energy level + priority matrix
  * Auto task creation from images (OCR / Image-to-Task)
  * Natural language chat for work status, deadlines, and habit analysis
* **Realtime Firestore sync**: Multi-device, permanent storage
* **Student-friendly UI**: Responsive design optimized for desktop/mobile usage patterns

### d. Technology Stack and Implementation Methods
